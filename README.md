# Python Poetry Monorepo powered by NX
A monorepo using [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [NX](https://nx.dev/). If you are looking for a quick-start guide, you found the right place.


## üîß IDE setup and tooling <a name="ide-setup-and-tooling"></a>
NX provides special tooling which can be used with some IDE's to improve the development experience. This includes a UI for running commands, executors and generators. Here is a list of available plugins for different IDE's:

- `VSCode`: Get the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console).
- `Jetbrains`: Get the extension [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21060-nx-console) plugin.


## üöÄ Generators
The internal `nx-python` library provides a few generators to quickly scaffold new projects, applications, and libraries. Here is a list of all available generators:

- `nx generate @nx-python-poetry/nx-python:poetry-project`: Creates a new poetry project. The project can either be a library or an application.
- `nx generate @nx-python-poetry/nx-python:fastapi-project`: Creates a new FastAPI project with all the necessary dependencies and minimal configuration.
- `nx generate @nx-python-poetry/nx-python:grpc-project`: Creates a new gRPC project with all the necessary dependencies and minimal configuration.
- `nx generate @nx-python-poetry/nx-python:shared-virtual-environment`: Migrates the current NX workspace to a shared virtual environment.

All generators come with pre-configured linting, type-checking, formatting and a testing. Both `FastAPI and gRPC` projects also provide a ready-to-go development server with HMR. The `shared-virtual-environment` generator is a bit special, so it will be explained in more detail in the section below.


### Shared virtual environment - The deep dive <a name="shared-virtual-environment"></a>
A shared virtual environment allows you to work from the root of the workspace while still being able to work with your services and libraries like before. This can also increase install times, since you only have to install the dependencies once.

#### Changes to the workspace
If you create a shared virtual environment using the `shared-virtual-environment` generator, the following changes will be applied to your workspace:

- A new `pyproject.toml` file will be created in the root of your workspace.
- A new `poetry.lock` file will be created in the root of your workspace.
- A new `poetry.toml` file will be created in the root of your workspace (This file only holds poetry-related configurations).
- A new `.venv` directory will be created in the root of your workspace (This is the actual environment you can use).


#### Requirements for using the shared virtual environment
Before you generate your shared virtual environment you have to make sure that the following requirements are met:
- The service/library has to be registered in the `NX workspace` (Happens automatically when using generators to create projects).
- There can be **`no version mismatches`** between any of the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` files of the services/libraries.

If any of these requirements are not met, the generator will throw an error and stop the process.


#### Syncing the shared virtual environment
Should you (for whatever reason) need to sync the shared virtual environment, you can do so by running the `install` executor in any of the projects. This will update the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files in the root of your workspace to match the dependencies of the projects in your workspace.

> **Note**: If you ever feel the need to manually update the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` anywhere (in which case you are either fucking around where you shouldn't or just fucking stupid), don't forget to run `nx run <project>:lock` after.


## üìú Executors
Like with generators, the internal `nx-python` library also provides a few executors to run common tasks. The easiest way to use executors is by using the UI provided by NX with plugins as described in the [`IDE setup and tooling`](#ide-setup-and-tooling) section. Here is a list of all available executors:


### Dependency management
The following executors can be used to manage dependencies in your projects:

- `nx run <project>:add`: Adds new dependencies to the project. If you want to add multiple dependencies, you can separate them with a comma. To add local libraries, you have to pass the `--local` flag. This executor accepts all flags which can be passed to `poetry's add` method.
- `nx run <project>:remove`: Removes dependencies from the project. If you want to remove multiple dependencies, you can separate them with a comma. To remove local libraries, you have to pass the `--local` flag. This executor accepts all flags which can be passed to `poetry's remove` method.
- `nx run <project>:update`: Updates dependencies in the project. If you want to update multiple dependencies, you can separate them with a comma. This executor accepts all flags which can be passed to `poetry's update` method.
- `nx run <project>:install`: Installs all dependencies in the project from the `poetry.lock` file. This executor accepts all flags which can be passed to `poetry's install` method.
- `nx run <project>:lock`: Locks all dependencies in the project to the `poetry.lock` file. This executor accepts all flags which can be passed to `poetry's lock` method.

> **Note**: If you have a shared virtual environment, all of the above commands will also affect the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files in the root of your workspace. So should you find yourself in a situation where the shared virtual environment is out of sync, you can just run `nx run <project>:install` in any workspace.


### Developing, testing and building your project
The following executors can be used to develop, test and build your projects:

- `nx run <project>:build`: Builds the project and all of it's libraries into a single packaged application.
- `nx run <project>:dev`: Starts a local development server with HMR enabled.
- `nx run <project>:pytest`: Runs all tests under the `tests` directory using `pytest` as a test runner.

> **Note**: The `build` executor is only available for projects of type `application` and the `dev` executor is only available for `FastAPI and gRPC projects`.


### Utility executors
There are also a few utility executors for linting, type-checking and formatting:

- `nx run <project>:black`: Code formatting with Black.
- `nx run <project>:pylint`: Linting with Pylint.
- `nx run <project>:pyright`: Type-checking with Pyright.


## üê≥ Usage with docker <a name="usage-with-docker"></a>
This monorepo provides a you with the ability to generate a `ready-to-go Dockerfile` with your `FastAPI or gRPC project`. To generate said Dockerfile when creating a new application, pass the `--includeDockerFile` flag to the generator. This will generate a Dockerfile in the root of your project which can be used to build a docker image.

> **Note**: When building the image, the `workspace root` must be passed as the `build context`. This is because we need to copy over the whole monorepo in order to prune and build it.


## üìä Dependency visualization
The internal `nx-python` library uses `implicitDependencies` for [`docker builds`](#usage-with-docker), which means it also enables the graph provided by NX to visualize the dependencies between python projects. Just run the following code in the command line:

```bash
nx graph
```
